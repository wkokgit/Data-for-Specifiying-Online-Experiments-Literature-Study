Doing so often requires sophisticated experimental designs, iterative refinement, and careful logging and analysis. Few tools exist that support these needs. We thus introduce a language for online field experiments called PlanOut. PlanOut separates experimental design from application code, allowing the experimenter to concisely describe experimental designs, whether common ""A/B tests"" and factorial designs, or more complex designs involving conditional logic or multiple experimental units. These latter designs are often useful for understanding causal mechanisms involved in user behaviors. We demonstrate how experiments from the literature can be implemented in PlanOut, and describe two large field experiments conducted on Facebook with PlanOut. For common scenarios in which experiments are run iteratively and in parallel, we introduce a namespaced management system that encourages sound experimental practice.","2014-04-07","2021-01-25 13:36:44","2021-01-25 13:36:44","2021-01-25","283–292","","","","","","","WWW '14","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\FK6MZBNA\Bakshy et al. - 2014 - Designing and deploying online field experiments.pdf","","","A/B testing; online experiments; methodology; toolkits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about applicability, implementation, and efficacy of experimentation for operating systems (OS), where many features are non-user-facing. In this paper, we present the Windows Experimentation platform (WExp), and insights from implementation and execution of real-world experiments in the OS. We start by discussing the need for experimentation in OS, using real experiments to illustrate the benefits. We then describe the architecture of WExp, focusing on unique considerations in its engineering. Finally, we discuss learnings and challenges from conducting real-world experiments. Our experiences and insights can motivate practitioners to start experimenting as well as to help them to successfully build their experimentation platforms. The learnings can also guide experimenters with best-practices and highlight promising avenues for future research.","2019-05","2021-02-02 08:58:28","2021-02-02 08:58:28","","21-30","","","","","","Experimentation in the Operating System","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\APYTIDPU\Li et al. - 2019 - Experimentation in the Operating System The Windo.pdf; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\HQ9SGBVN\8804438.html","","","Internet; Testing; online controlled experiments; Computer architecture; experimentation platforms; experimentation, operating systems, measurement, a/b testing, online controlled experiments; gold standard; Hardware; Microsoft Windows; online worlds; operating system; operating systems (computers); OS; real-world experiments; Technological innovation; WExp; windows experimentation platform","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we provide measurement results of 575 websites that use Optimizely drawn from the Alexa Top-1M, and analyze the distributions of their audiences and experiments. Then, we use three case studies to discuss potential ethical pitfalls of such experiments, including involvement of political content, price discrimination, and advertising campaigns. We conclude with a suggestion for greater awareness of ethical concerns inherent in human experimentation and a call for increased transparency among A/B/n test operators.","2019-01-29","2021-02-02 09:07:53","2021-02-02 09:07:53","2021-02-02","201–210","","","","","","Who's the Guinea Pig?","FAT* '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\PZXABADK\Jiang et al. - 2019 - Who's the Guinea Pig Investigating Online ABn T.pdf","","","online controlled experiments; personalization; A/B/n testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A/B testing is a technique to distinguish between the popularity and usability of two quite similar versions (A and B) of a product, marketing strategy, search ad, etc. It is a kind of two-sample hypothesis testing, used in the field of statistics. This controlled experiment can evaluate user engagement or satisfaction with a new service, feature, or product. A/B testing is typically used in evaluation of user-experience design in software technology. DevOps is an emerging software methodology in which the development and operations are not independent processes, they affect each other. DevOps emphasizes the usage of virtualization technologies (e.g. containers). Docker is widely-used technology for containerization. In this paper, we deal with a new approach for regular A/B testing via Docker containers. Our solution provides an API that can be available from many DevOps tools. This approach is DevOps-style A/B testing because after the evaluation the better version remains in production.","2019-03-15","2021-02-02 09:12:35","2021-02-02 09:12:35","2021-02-02","11–14","","","","","","","ICGDA 2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\ZRRCY84S\Révész and Pataki - 2019 - Continuous AB Testing in Containers.pdf","","","A/B testing; containers; DevOps; Docker","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is used to formalize ideas as a plan of action and to document attained knowledge. Although there is a large body of research on continuous experimentation, the definition of experiments is not researched sufficiently. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of characteristics of continuous experiment definitions. The taxonomy is synthesized from a systematic literature review and a tool review of experimentation platforms. Our findings show amongst others that there are 17 characteristics of experiment definitions. Moreover, that platforms primarily focus on the execution of experiments and that experimentation is more than the execution of an experiment.","2020-08","2021-02-02 10:22:18","2021-02-02 10:22:18","","186-190","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\I7K68MXX\Auer et al. - 2020 - Continuous Experiment Definition Characteristics.pdf; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\LMT5CFLT\9226347.html","","","Taxonomy; online controlled experimentation; Testing; experimentation platforms; Bibliographies; continuous experiment definition characteristics; continuous experiment definitions; continuous experimentation; continuous experiments; Organizations; software development management; systematic literature review; Systematics; taxonomy; tool review; Tools; Vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 46th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
