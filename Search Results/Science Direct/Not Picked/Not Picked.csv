The experiment was designed to eliminate an unforeseen opportunity to practice with minimal effort. Some children tend to skip problems that require deliberate effort, and only attempt problems that they can spontaneously answer. The intervention delayed the option to skip a problem, thereby promoting effortful practice. The results reveal an increase in the exerted effort, without being at the expense of engagement. Whether the additional effort positively affected the children's learning gains could not be concluded. Finally, in addition to these substantial results, the experiment demonstrates some of the advantages of A/B tests, such as the unique opportunity to apply truly blind randomized field experiments in educational science.","2018-04-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:37","84-94","","","119","","Computers & Education","Delaying access to a problem-skipping option increases effortful practice","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\M9YNJIKN\S0360131517302737.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\6TDFCSKH\Savi et al. - 2018 - Delaying access to a problem-skipping option incre.pdf","","","Elementary education; Evaluation methodologies; Evaluation of CAL systems; Interactive learning environments; Teaching/learning strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research.","2020-11-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","106368","","","127","","Information and Software Technology","Large-scale machine learning systems in real-world industrial settings","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\T3G486K7\S0950584920301373.html","","","Challenges; Industrial settings; Machine learning systems; SLR; Software engineering; Solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, we conduct an online experiment on consumer perceptions of scarcity.

Design mechanisms employing social influence tactics seem to be promising avenues to effectively improve user onboarding experiences. Specifically, two social influence tactics—namely, reciprocity and social proof—are widely used in practice to reliably enhance user registrations. Yet, researchers have only tentatively examined how these combined tactics affect user onboarding behavior. While combining both tactics may hold synergistic potential, it may also be counterproductive, as too much social influence may backfire. We address this research gap by investigating the distinct and joint effects of reciprocity and social proof on user registration behavior. Drawing on two forms of reciprocity (i.e., utility- and monetary-based reciprocity), we conduct an online experiment (N = 249) and a related randomized field experiment (N = 475,495) to compare both reciprocity variants in combination with social proof and investigate their efficacy for actual user onboarding decisions (i.e., user registrations). Our results show that both social influence tactics and both reciprocity variants have positive effects on users' registration behavior if applied individually. However, when both tactics are employed together, the effect of reciprocity is moderated by social proof such that social proof nullifies the effect of monetary-based reciprocity whereas it amplifies the effect of utility-based reciprocity. Our study thereby contributes to a more advanced understanding of the interactive relationship between reciprocity and social proof and their joint effect on user onboarding decisions.","2020-04-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","113268","","","131","","Decision Support Systems","Social influence tactics in e-commerce onboarding","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\77N7JWMV\S0167923620300233.html","","","E-commerce; Reciprocity; Social influence; Social proof; User onboarding; User registration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We study how the presence of heavy tails in the distribution of shocks affects the optimal allocation of prizes in rank-order tournaments à la Lazear and Rosen (1981). While a winner-take-all prize schedule maximizes aggregate effort for light-tailed shocks, prize sharing becomes optimal when shocks acquire heavy tails, increasingly so following a skewness order. Extreme prize sharing—rewarding all ranks but the very last—is optimal when shocks have a decreasing failure rate, such as power laws. Hence, under heavy-tailed uncertainty, typically associated with strong inequality in the distribution of gains, providing incentives and reducing inequality go hand in hand.","2020-11-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","105116","","","190","","Journal of Economic Theory","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\PXV34F37\S0022053120301095.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\H3S5I2CP\Drugov and Ryvkin - 2020 - Tournament rewards and heavy tails.pdf","","","Failure rate; Heavy tails; Optimal allocation of prizes; Power law; Tournament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most critical is the filter bubbles creation, a situation where a user receives less content diversity. In the news domain, such effect is critical once they are ways of opinion formation. In this paper, we aim to assess the role that a specific set of recommender algorithms has in the creation of filter bubbles and if diversification approaches can decrease such effect. We also verify the effects of such an environment in the users’ exposition and interaction to fake news in the Brazilian presidential election of 2018. To perform such a study, we developed a prototype that recommends news stories and presents these recommendations in a feed. To measure the filter bubble, we introduce a new metric based on the homogenization of a recommended items’ set.

Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA). Method: As the primary method to find relevant literature on the topic, we performed manual search and snowballing on papers published between 2011 and 2019. Results: In total, 88 primary studies were selected and analyzed. Our results show that BDA is employed throughout the whole ASD lifecycle. The results reveal that data-driven software development is focused on the following areas: code repository analytics, defects/bug fixing, testing, project management analytics, and application usage analytics. Conclusions: As BDA and ASD are fast-developing areas, improving the productivity of software development teams is one of the most important objectives BDA is facing in the industry. This study provides scholars with information about the state of software analytics research and the current trends as well as applications in the business environment.

Linguistic elements that influence the perceived happiness of a (human) sender of text messages were identified in a pilot study, and they were used to manipulate VA display of happiness in two experiments. In addition, a field study was carried out to capitalize on customers’ existing experience of service encounters with VAs in bona fide commercial settings. The experiments showed that VA text manipulated to signal VA happiness boosts overall VA evaluations, and the field study showed that perceived VA happiness is positively associated with overall VA evaluations. Taken together, the findings indicate that we humans are so hardwired for interactions with other humans that we react to VA display of happiness in ways that resemble our reactions when we are exposed to happy humans.

This study contributes to an emerging body of research on the use of AR in the early stages of customers’ purchase journeys. Extending previous research, we propose that AR enables a unique form of customer creativity that is distinct from prior conceptualizations of creativity through its association with customer engagement. Specifically, we propose a sequential process of creative customer engagement, in which AR-enabled customer creativity stems from heightened customer engagement and, in turn, offers a source of intrinsic satisfaction for customers. In an experiment with a customer-facing AR application, we empirically demonstrate this sequential mediation process connecting the use of AR with customer engagement, customer creativity, and anticipated satisfaction. We also identify an important boundary condition based on a customer’s assessment orientation, suggesting a novel behavioral effect in the context of regulatory mode theory.","2020-08-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","85-98","","","116","","Journal of Business Research","The playground effect","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\6XLX595Y\S0148296320302952.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\YPUG2YIZ\Jessen et al. - 2020 - The playground effect How augmented reality drive.pdf","","","Augmented Reality; Customer creativity; Customer engagement; Purchase journey; Regulatory mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E-commerce retailers have utilized to great effect lists of top ranked products to promote product sales; the higher the sales rank, the more likely consumers buy that product. This influence to buy, based on observing what others bought is known as observational learning (OL). Prior OL research assumed that OL arises from observing a static outcome, such as the current sales rank of a product. However, prior research on intertemporal choice showed that people prefer outcomes with increasing trends over stable or decreasing trends. This suggests that observing an increasing sales rank, denoted as sales velocity, would have a positive effect on purchase likelihood. We conducted three studies to test the sales velocity effect. Results show that sales velocity has a significant effect on likelihood of purchases, reversing even participant preferences for a product with a higher sales rank. This effect is consistent across four broad products tested. For researchers, by joining the two previously disparate branches of research in OL and intertemporal choice, we addressed a gap in OL research which previously ignored the velocity dimension of OL. For retailers, the study demonstrated the impact of the sales velocity metric on making choices, and thus they could use sales velocity data as a cost-effective marketing tool for specific products.","2014-11-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","237-256","","4","28","","Journal of Interactive Marketing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\636PIRV2\S1094996814000322.html","","","Consumer choice; Internet marketing; Observational learning; Online experiment; Social influences; Social learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This problem is known as Pure Cold-Start and it refers to the capability of Recommender Systems (RSs) providing useful recommendations to users without historical data. Traditionally, the systems assume that items biased by popularity, recency and positive ratings suit the interests of most first-time users. However, our studies confirm a contra-intuitive hypothesis, showing users consumption preferences biased to non-popular items. For this reason, we introduce two new RSs to mitigate this problem based on user coverage maximization: Max-Coverage and Category-Exploration. Offline experiments show that our recommendations complement the traditional ones. Thus, we found an opportunity for improvements on state-of-the-art RSs. We hypothesize that combining distinct non-personalized RSs can be better to conquer the most first-time users than traditional ones. An online study conducted with 236 real users in movie domain reinforced this hypothesis. Hence, this study provides a clear message: we should compose product pages that mix complementary non-personalized RSs.","2019-02-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:38","1-12","","","80","","Information Systems","The Pure Cold-Start Problem","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\D2HAJKHG\S0306437918303260.html","","","e-commerce systems; First-time users; Non-personalized recommender systems; Pure Cold-Start problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Voting advice applications (VAAs) recommend parties and candidates that are close to a citizen's political preferences and require the constrution of candidate and party profiles. Profile generation is an essential task in the development of VAAs and requires two steps: an unbiased design of political questionnaires and the collection of all candidates' answers. This paper presents an extension of a VAA, implemented in within the project Participa Inteligente (PI), a social-network platform designed for the 2017 Ecuadorian national elections. This work concentrates on the implementation of dynamic candidate profiling using Twitter data and sentiment analysis as an additional element to the static profile generation of VAAs. The implementation of a dynamic element for VAAs could help mitigate the effect of biased recommendations given during the construction of candidate and party profiles. At the end of this work, the dynamic profile is compared with the classic static elements developed within the PI project. The results show the level of similarities and differences between each of the elements in profile generation. This work provides an ideal basis for future research in the area of VAAs and their interfaces. Additionally, it opens up a broader spectrum of applications for policymakers including decision-making and collaborative working environments toward e-empowerment.","2019-07-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:38","520-535","","3","36","","Government Information Quarterly","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\38VCLMKG\S0740624X18300716.html","","","Decision-making; Dynamic profiles; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis; Voting advice applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A lab-based randomized controlled experiment was conducted with 233 undergraduate students to investigate the behavioral effects of fake news. It was found that even short (under 5-min) exposure to fake news was able to significantly modify the unconscious behavior of individuals. This paper provides initial evidence that fake news can be used to covertly modify behavior, it argues that current approaches to mitigating fake news, and disinformation in general, are insufficient to protect social media users from this threat, and it highlights the implications of this for democracy. It raises the need for an urgent cross-sectoral effort to investigate, protect against, and mitigate the risks of covert, widespread and decentralized behavior modification over online social networks.","2021-03-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","106633","","","116","","Computers in Human Behavior","Would you notice if fake news changed your behavior?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\7XYDEEAR\S0747563220303800.html","","","Behavior; Disinformation; Emotions; Fake news; Finger tapping; Misinformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that hypervideo navigation, coupled with interactive visualisations, improved sensemaking of televised political debates and promoted people's attitude to challenging personal assumptions. This finding suggests that hypervideo interfaces can play a substantial role in supporting citizens in the complex sensemaking process of informing their political choices during an election campaign, and can be used as instruments to promote critical thinking and political opinion shifting.","2021-01-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","102537","","","145","","International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","Let's replay the political debate","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\SXG8UMLQ\S1071581920301397.html","","","Advanced visual interfaces; Deliberation within; Hypervideo; Interactive visualisations; Political election debates; Public deliberation; Sensemaking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
