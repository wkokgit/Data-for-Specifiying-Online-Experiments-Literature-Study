However, controlled laboratory and crowdsourcing settings often introduce issues of artificiality, data contamination, and low managerial relevance of the dependent variables. Field experiments can overcome these issues but are traditionally time- and resource-consuming. This primer presents an alternative experimental setting to conduct online field experiments in a time- and cost-effective way. It does so by introducing the Facebook A/B split test functionality, which allows for random assignment of manipulated variables embedded in ecologically-valid stimuli. We compare and contrast this method against laboratory settings and Amazon Mechanical Turk in terms of design flexibility, managerial relevance, data quality control, and sample representativeness. We then provide an empirical demonstration of how to set up, pre-test, run, and analyze FBST experiments.","2020-09-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","189-198","","","118","","Journal of Business Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\ILNREKVE\S014829632030429X.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\TK26R4X5\Orazi and Johnston - 2020 - Running field experiments using Facebook split tes.pdf","","","Ecological validity; Experimental research; Facebook; Field study; Online advertising; Split testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Product and service developers must continuously find out what customers want by direct customer feedback and usage behaviour observation. Objective: This paper examines the preconditions for setting up an experimentation system for continuous customer experiments. It describes the RIGHT model for Continuous Experimentation (Rapid Iterative value creation Gained through High-frequency Testing), illustrating the building blocks required for such a system. Method: An initial model for continuous experimentation is analytically derived from prior work. The model is matched against empirical case study findings from two startup companies and further developed. Results: Building blocks for a continuous experimentation system and infrastructure are presented. Conclusions: A suitable experimentation system requires at least the ability to release minimum viable products or features with suitable instrumentation, design and manage experiment plans, link experiment results with a product roadmap, and manage a flexible business strategy. The main challenges are proper, rapid design of experiments, advanced instrumentation of software to collect, analyse, and store relevant data, and the integration of experiment results in both the product development cycle and the software development process.","2017-01-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","292-305","","","123","","Journal of Systems and Software","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\7EWCUEHF\S0164121216300024.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\BIWFNGU5\Fagerholm et al. - 2017 - The RIGHT model for Continuous Experimentation.pdf","","","Agile software development; Continuous experimentation; Lean software development; Product development; Software architecture; Software development process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
