It is widely used in the industry to test changes ranging from simple copy change or UI change to more complex changes like using machine learning models to personalize user experience. The key aspect of A/B testing is evaluation of experiment results. Designing the right set of metrics - correct outcome measures, data quality indicators, guardrails that prevent harm to business, and a comprehensive set of supporting metrics to understand the “why” behind the key movements is the #1 challenge practitioners face when trying to scale their experimentation program 11, 14. On the technical side, improving sensitivity of experiment metrics is a hard problem and an active research area, with large practical implications as more and more small and medium size businesses are trying to adopt A/B testing and suffer from insufficient power. In this tutorial we will discuss challenges, best practices, and pitfalls in evaluating experiment results, focusing on both lessons learned and practical guidelines as well as open research questions. A version of this tutorial was also present at KDD 2019 23. It was attended by around 150 participants. This tutorial has also been accepted for the WSDM 2020 conference.","2020-04-20","2021-01-22 10:16:20","2021-01-22 10:16:20","2021-01-22","317–319","","","","","","","WWW '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The adaptive sequential experimentation techniques described can be used to help tackle a myriad of problems including optimizing a system's click-through or conversion rate via online A/B testing, tuning parameters of a machine learning prediction method or expensive batch job, designing an engineering system or finding the optimal parameters of a real-world physical experiment. We explore different tools available for performing these tasks, including Yelp's MOE and SigOpt. We will present the motivation, implementation, and background of these tools. Applications and examples from industry and best practices for using the techniques will be provided.","2015-05-18","2021-01-22 10:16:20","2021-01-22 10:16:20","2021-01-22","911","","","","","","","WWW '15 Companion","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","a/b testing; bayesian global optimization; design of experiments; hyperparmeter tuning; optimal learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
