The most common form of online experimentation, A/B testing, is widely used in practice, and has helped sustain continuous improvement of the current generation of these systems.As online experimentation is taking a more and more central role in IR research and practice, new techniques are being developed to address, e.g., questions regarding the scale and fidelity of experiments in online settings. This paper gives an overview of the currently available tools. This includes techniques that are already in wide use, such as A/B testing and interleaved comparisons, as well as techniques that have been developed more recently, such as bandit approaches for online learning to rank.This paper summarizes and connects the wide range of techniques and insights that have been developed in this field to date. It concludes with an outlook on open questions and directions for ongoing and future research.","2015","2021-01-22 10:28:30","2021-01-22 10:28:30","2021-01-22 10:28:30","21-41","","","","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-25485-2_2","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\UZGBA8DV\Hofmann - 2015 - Online Experimentation for Information Retrieval.pdf","","","A/B testing; Contextual bandits; Counterfactual analysis; Dueling bandits; Experiment design; Interleaved comparison; Online evaluation; Online learning to rank","Braslavski, Pavel; Karpov, Nikolay; Worring, Marcel; Volkovich, Yana; Ignatov, Dmitry I.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There have been several attempts to integrate user-centered design with agile methods, but it is hard to synchronize their practices. User testing is very valuable to learn from feedback of actual use, but it remains expensive to find and solve usability problems. Furthermore, the high cost of usability evaluation forces small/medium-sized companies to trust the first solution applied, without actually testing the success of the solution or considering a possible regression in usability, as could be highlighted by an iterative testing method. In this article, we advocate for a usability improvement cycle oriented by user feedback, and compatible with an agile development process. We propose an iterative method supported by a toolkit that allows usability experts to design user tests, run them remotely, analyze results, and assess alternative solutions to usability problems similarly to A/B testing. Each solution is created by applying client-side web refactorings, i.e., changes to the web pages in the client which are meant to improve usability. The main benefit of our approach is that it reduces the overall cost of user testing and particularly, A/B testing, by applying refactorings to create alternative solutions without modifying the application’s server code. By making it affordable for usability experts to apply the method in parallel with the development cycle, we aim to encourage them to incorporate user feedback and try different ideas to discover the best-performing solution in terms of the metrics of interest.","2019-03-01","2021-01-22 10:29:17","2021-01-22 10:29:17","2021-01-22 10:29:17","203-240","","1","27","","Software Qual J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\L6V7Z5VP\Firmenich et al. - 2019 - Usability improvement through AB testing and refa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the number of experiments scale, companies aim to invest their experimentation resources in larger feature changes and leave the automated techniques to optimize smaller features. Optimization experiments in the continuous space are encompassed in the many-armed bandits class of problems. Although previous research provides algorithms for solving this class of problems, these algorithms were not implemented in real-world online experimentation problems and do not consider the application constraints, such as time to compute a solution, selection of a best arm and the estimation of the mean-reward function. This work discusses the online experiments in context of the many-armed bandits class of problems and provides three main contributions: (1) an algorithm modification to include online experiments constraints, (2) implementation of this algorithm in an industrial setting in collaboration with Sony Mobile, and (3) statistical evidence that supports the modification of the algorithm for online experiments scenarios. These contributions support the relevance of the LG-HOO algorithm in the context of optimization experiments and show how the algorithm can be used to support continuous optimization of online systems in stochastic scenarios.","2018","2021-01-22 10:29:22","2021-01-22 10:29:22","","293-308","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\8SU6TIXE\Mattos et al. - 2018 - Optimization Experiments in the Continuous Space.pdf","","","Continuous-space optimization; Infinitely many-armed bandits; Multi-armed bandits; Online experiments","Colanzi, Thelma Elita; McMinn, Phil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these experiments often require expensive infrastructure and are costly in terms of development effort.
