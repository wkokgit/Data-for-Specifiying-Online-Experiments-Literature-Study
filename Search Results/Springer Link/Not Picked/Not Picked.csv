Online controlled experiments, also known as A/B tests, enable software companies to establish causal relationships between changes in their systems and the movements in the metrics. By experimenting, product development can be directed towards identifying and delivering value. Previous research stresses the need for data-driven development and experimentation. However, the level of granularity in which existing models explain the experimentation process is neither sufficient, in terms of details, nor scalable, in terms of how to increase number and run different types of experiments, in an online setting. Based on a case study of multiple products running online controlled experiments at Microsoft, we provide an experimentation framework composed of two detailed experimentation models focused on two main aspects; the experimentation activities and the experimentation metrics. This work intends to provide guidelines to companies and practitioners on how to set and organize experimentation activities for running trustworthy online controlled experiments.","2018","2021-01-22 10:28:16","2021-01-22 10:28:16","","182-198","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\BCIE8E6W\Issa Mattos et al. - 2018 - An Activity and Metric Model for Online Controlled.pdf","","","A/B tests; Data-driven development; Online controlled experiments","Kuhrmann, Marco; Schneider, Kurt; Pfahl, Dietmar; Amasaki, Sousuke; Ciolkowski, Marcus; Hebig, Regina; Tell, Paolo; Klünder, Jil; Küpper, Steffen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In online companies, controlled experimentation is the primary technique to measure how customers respond to variants of deployed software. In B2B companies, an interest for data driven development is rapidly emerging and experiments are run on selected instances of the system or as comparisons of previously computed data to ensure quality, improve configurations and explore new value propositions. Although the adoption of data driven development is challenging in general, it is especially so for embedded systems companies and for companies developing on-premise software solutions. Due to complex systems with hardware dependencies, safety-critical functionality and strict regulations, these companies have longer development cycles, less frequent deployments and limited access to data. In this paper, and based on multi-case study research, we explore the specific challenges that embedded systems companies and companies developing on-premise solutions experience when adopting data driven development practices. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we provide empirical evidence in which we identify the key challenges that embedded systems and on-premise software solutions companies experience as they evolve through the process of adopting data driven development practices. Second, we define the key focus areas that these companies need to address for evolving their data driven development adoption process .","2019","2021-01-22 10:28:40","2021-01-22 10:28:40","","515-527","","","","","","Data Driven Development","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\L5YKUIES\Holmström Olsson and Bosch - 2019 - Data Driven Development Challenges in Online, Emb.pdf","","","Adoption process; Challenges; Data driven development; Embedded systems; On-premise solutions; Online software","Franch, Xavier; Männistö, Tomi; Martínez-Fernández, Silverio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of these experiments focus on evaluating the front-end of the application and specifically different visual aspects, e.g. creating variations of the layouts, fonts, colors of the site, etc. In this paper we want to experiment whether A/B testing can be used to evaluate e-commerce sales processes and to improve the resilience of these processes. To achieve this goal we developed a tool in collaboration with a company, called Sonician AB, which is focused on marketing automation. The tool has been designed to empower business owners with a virtual assistant able to help customers understanding their needs and making decisions while purchasing products or services. The tool has been evaluated within the company and instantiated in two different business flow cases. Two experiments under real-life conditions show promising results. The paper concludes with lessons learned and a set of guidelines designed to help companies with interest of conducting similar experiments.","2016","2021-01-22 10:28:47","2021-01-22 10:28:47","","133-148","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\UY672JQP\Koukouvis et al. - 2016 - AB Testing in E-commerce Sales Processes.pdf","","","Business Owner; Database Module; Decision Assistant; Sales Process; Visual Aspect","Crnkovic, Ivica; Troubitsyna, Elena","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real-world ML applications help companies to improve products and automate tasks such as classification, image recognition and automation. However, a traditional “fixed” approach where the system is frozen before deployment leads to a sub-optimal system performance. Systems autonomously experimenting with and improving their own behavior and performance could improve business outcomes but we need to know how this could actually work in practice. While there is some research on autonomously improving systems, the focus on the concepts and theoretical algorithms. However, less research is focused on empirical industry validation of the proposed theory. Empirical validations are usually done through simulations or by using synthetic or manually alteration of datasets. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we conduct a systematic literature review in which we focus on papers describing industrial deployments of autonomously improving systems and their real-world applications. Secondly, we identify open research questions and derive a model that classifies the level of autonomy based on our findings in the literature review.","2021","2021-01-22 10:28:56","2021-01-22 10:28:56","","30-45","","","","","","Autonomously Improving Systems in Industry","Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\WH9ELB7V\Green et al. - 2021 - Autonomously Improving Systems in Industry A Syst.pdf","","","AI engineering; Autonomously improving systems; Empirical validation; Industrial application; Machine learning","Klotins, Eriks; Wnuk, Krzysztof","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO). We provide several examples of controlled experiments with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running controlled experiments, and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. Controlled experiments typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain deeper understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements. Organizations that embrace controlled experiments with clear evaluation criteria can evolve their systems with automated optimizations and real-time analyses.

Unfortunately, unless university-based researchers closely collaborate with industry or develop their own infrastructure or user base, they cannot validate their ideas in live settings with real users. Without online testing opportunities open to the research communities, academic researchers are unable to employ online evaluation on a larger scale. This means that they do not get feedback for their ideas and cannot advance their research further. Businesses, on the other hand, miss the opportunity to have higher customer satisfaction due to improved systems. In addition, users miss the chance to benefit from an improved information access system. In this chapter, we introduce two evaluation initiatives at CLEF, NewsREEL and Living Labs for IR (LL4IR), that aim to address this growing “evaluation gap” between academia and industry.

Evaluation plays the exact key role in the field of information retrieval. Researchers and practitioners develop models to explain the relation between an information need expressed by a person and information contained in available resources, and test these models by comparing their outcomes to collections of observations.This article is a short survey on methods, measures, and designs used in the field of Information Retrieval to evaluate the quality of search algorithms (aka the implementation of a model) against collections of observations. The phrase “search quality” has more than one interpretations, however here I will only discuss one of these interpretations, the effectiveness of a search algorithm to find the information requested by a user.

For example, a social media website may need to quickly identify status updates linking to malicious websites to block them. The URL is very concise, and may be composed of concatenated words so classification with only this information is a very challenging task. Methods proposed for this task, for example, the all-grams approach which extracts all possible sub-strings as features, provide reasonable accuracy but do not scale well to large datasets.We have recently proposed a new method for URL-based web page classification. We have introduced an n-gram language model for this task as a method that provides competitive accuracy and scalability to larger datasets. Our method allows for the classification of new URLs with unseen sub-sequences. In this paper we extend our presentation and include additional results to validate the proposed approach. We explain the parameters associated with the n-gram language model and test their impact on the models produced. Our results show that our method is competitive in terms of accuracy with the best known methods but also scales well for larger datasets.","2015","2021-01-22 10:29:39","2021-01-22 10:29:39","","19-33","","","","","","URL-Based Web Page Classification","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\78RKZNEB\Abdallah and de La Iglesia - 2015 - URL-Based Web Page Classification With n-Gram Lan.pdf","","","Information retrieval; Language models; Machine learning; Web classification; Web mining","Fred, Ana; Dietz, Jan L.

We address researchers from both research communities and provide (1) introductory notions into both fields, (2) an analysis of ESE experiment requirements and HC capabilities that could match those, and (3) a concrete example of an ESE experiment that compares the effects of using HC in software inspection with respect to a traditional inspection process preformed using pen and paper. Our focus is on software inspection for detecting defects in software engineering models (namely, extended entity relationship models). This chapter will enable ESE researchers to apply HC in their work and HC researchers to explore ESE as a new application area to further improve their methods and tools.","2020","2021-01-22 10:29:45","2021-01-22 10:29:45","2021-01-22 10:29:45","173-215","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-32489-6_7","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\8NRWF2X6\Sabou et al. - 2020 - Empirical Software Engineering Experimentation wit.pdf","","","Crowdsourcing; Experiment data collection; Experimentation; Human computation","Felderer, Michael; Travassos, Guilherme Horta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One objective of peers in such a community is sharing common interests, even when compromising privacy. This paper presents a model for peers on the Internet that allows them to discover their common interests in terms of sets of frequently visited URLs. This model assists online learning by automatically presenting users with URLs related to what they are currently browsing, thus saving users’ time searching for additional information and helping to educate them on the current topic. To implement the model and collect test data, FireShare was developed as a plugin for the popular Web browser Firefox. Data was collected and analyzed on the number of discovered frequently visited URL sets, relevancy of mined association rules, and the overhead FireShare imposes on a network. While FireShare favorably validated the proposed model, analysis of the submitted test data shows high potential for success with future versions.","2011-01-01","2021-01-22 10:29:48","2021-01-22 10:29:48","2021-01-22 10:29:48","31-58","","1","26","","Knowl Inf Syst","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\DK9Z2BF8\Muhlestein and Lim - 2011 - Online learning with social computing based intere.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
