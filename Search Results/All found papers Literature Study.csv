The experiment was designed to eliminate an unforeseen opportunity to practice with minimal effort. Some children tend to skip problems that require deliberate effort, and only attempt problems that they can spontaneously answer. The intervention delayed the option to skip a problem, thereby promoting effortful practice. The results reveal an increase in the exerted effort, without being at the expense of engagement. Whether the additional effort positively affected the children's learning gains could not be concluded. Finally, in addition to these substantial results, the experiment demonstrates some of the advantages of A/B tests, such as the unique opportunity to apply truly blind randomized field experiments in educational science.","2018-04-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:37","84-94","","","119","","Computers & Education","Delaying access to a problem-skipping option increases effortful practice","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\M9YNJIKN\S0360131517302737.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\6TDFCSKH\Savi et al. - 2018 - Delaying access to a problem-skipping option incre.pdf","","","Elementary education; Evaluation methodologies; Evaluation of CAL systems; Interactive learning environments; Teaching/learning strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research.","2020-11-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","106368","","","127","","Information and Software Technology","Large-scale machine learning systems in real-world industrial settings","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\T3G486K7\S0950584920301373.html","","","Challenges; Industrial settings; Machine learning systems; SLR; Software engineering; Solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the many technological advancements that may be included in a recommender system, engineers are faced with a fast growing number of design related decisions to be taken. Unfortunately, there is no general approach yet for decision makers that can act as a framework guiding the design of a recommender system. The rich collection of literature on recommender systems, though, offers a great source to identify the key areas where these decisions need to be taken. In this paper, we survey existing literature with the aim of building a recommender system model inspired by Osterwalder’s canvas theory. The result of our semi-structured synthesis is a novel design approach in the form of a canvas for designing recommender systems. This work provides a better understanding and can serve as a guide for decision making in recommender system design.","2019-09-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:37","97-117","","","129","","Expert Systems with Applications","The recommender canvas","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\J9AQZGJE\S0957417419302313.html; C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\GND7J6SE\van Capelleveen et al. - 2019 - The recommender canvas A model for developing and.pdf","","","Design decisions; Recommender canvas; Recommender system; Requirement specification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How scarcity cues affect booking intentions on hospitality platforms","Electronic Commerce Research and Applications","","1567-4223","10.1016/j.elerap.2019.100910","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567422319300870","Communication of scarcity has emerged as a fundamental marketing principle in electronic commerce and for hospitality platforms in particular. We investigate the effect of scarcity cues on consumer behavior. First, we explore actual market data from Airbnb and Booking.com, and find that scarcity cues are used differently by hotel versus peer-based hospitality platforms. Second, we conduct an online experiment on consumer perceptions of scarcity. Specifically, we find support for two distinct effect paths, along which scarcity perceptions lead to increased booking intentions through urgency (the get-it-before-it’s-gone effect) and value (the must-be-good effect). We discuss practical implications of our results as well as the potential for the misuse of scarcity claims for unfair competition.","2020-01-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:37","100910","","","39","","Electronic Commerce Research and Applications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\92G3G37U\S1567422319300870.html","","","Consumer behavior; Marketing research; Platform economy; Scarcity cues; Urgency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design mechanisms employing social influence tactics seem to be promising avenues to effectively improve user onboarding experiences. Specifically, two social influence tactics—namely, reciprocity and social proof—are widely used in practice to reliably enhance user registrations. Yet, researchers have only tentatively examined how these combined tactics affect user onboarding behavior. While combining both tactics may hold synergistic potential, it may also be counterproductive, as too much social influence may backfire. We address this research gap by investigating the distinct and joint effects of reciprocity and social proof on user registration behavior. Drawing on two forms of reciprocity (i.e., utility- and monetary-based reciprocity), we conduct an online experiment (N = 249) and a related randomized field experiment (N = 475,495) to compare both reciprocity variants in combination with social proof and investigate their efficacy for actual user onboarding decisions (i.e., user registrations). Our results show that both social influence tactics and both reciprocity variants have positive effects on users' registration behavior if applied individually. However, when both tactics are employed together, the effect of reciprocity is moderated by social proof such that social proof nullifies the effect of monetary-based reciprocity whereas it amplifies the effect of utility-based reciprocity. Our study thereby contributes to a more advanced understanding of the interactive relationship between reciprocity and social proof and their joint effect on user onboarding decisions.","2020-04-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:37","113268","","","131","","Decision Support Systems","Social influence tactics in e-commerce onboarding","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\77N7JWMV\S0167923620300233.html","","","E-commerce; Reciprocity; Social influence; Social proof; User onboarding; User registration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extreme prize sharing—rewarding all ranks but the very last—is optimal when shocks have a decreasing failure rate, such as power laws.

One of the most critical is the filter bubbles creation, a situation where a user receives less content diversity. In the news domain, such effect is critical once they are ways of opinion formation. In this paper, we aim to assess the role that a specific set of recommender algorithms has in the creation of filter bubbles and if diversification approaches can decrease such effect. We also verify the effects of such an environment in the users’ exposition and interaction to fake news in the Brazilian presidential election of 2018. To perform such a study, we developed a prototype that recommends news stories and presents these recommendations in a feed. To measure the filter bubble, we introduce a new metric based on the homogenization of a recommended items’ set.

Objective: Although a myriad of research exists on software analytics as well as on Agile software development (ASD) practice on itself, there exists no systematic overview of the research done on ASD from a data analytics perspective. Therefore, the objective of this work is to make progress by linking ASD with Big Data analytics (BDA).

Specifically, we propose a sequential process of creative customer engagement, in which AR-enabled customer creativity stems from heightened customer engagement and, in turn, offers a source of intrinsic satisfaction for customers. In an experiment with a customer-facing AR application, we empirically demonstrate this sequential mediation process connecting the use of AR with customer engagement, customer creativity, and anticipated satisfaction.

E-commerce retailers have utilized to great effect lists of top ranked products to promote product sales; the higher the sales rank, the more likely consumers buy that product. This influence to buy, based on observing what others bought is known as observational learning (OL). Prior OL research assumed that OL arises from observing a static outcome, such as the current sales rank of a product. However, prior research on intertemporal choice showed that people prefer outcomes with increasing trends over stable or decreasing trends. This suggests that observing an increasing sales rank, denoted as sales velocity, would have a positive effect on purchase likelihood. We conducted three studies to test the sales velocity effect. Results show that sales velocity has a significant effect on likelihood of purchases, reversing even participant preferences for a product with a higher sales rank. This effect is consistent across four broad products tested. For researchers, by joining the two previously disparate branches of research in OL and intertemporal choice, we addressed a gap in OL research which previously ignored the velocity dimension of OL. For retailers, the study demonstrated the impact of the sales velocity metric on making choices, and thus they could use sales velocity data as a cost-effective marketing tool for specific products.","2014-11-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:29:38","237-256","","4","28","","Journal of Interactive Marketing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\636PIRV2\S1094996814000322.html","","","Consumer choice; Internet marketing; Observational learning; Online experiment; Social influences; Social learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This problem is known as Pure Cold-Start and it refers to the capability of Recommender Systems (RSs) providing useful recommendations to users without historical data. Traditionally, the systems assume that items biased by popularity, recency and positive ratings suit the interests of most first-time users. However, our studies confirm a contra-intuitive hypothesis, showing users consumption preferences biased to non-popular items. For this reason, we introduce two new RSs to mitigate this problem based on user coverage maximization: Max-Coverage and Category-Exploration. Offline experiments show that our recommendations complement the traditional ones. Thus, we found an opportunity for improvements on state-of-the-art RSs. We hypothesize that combining distinct non-personalized RSs can be better to conquer the most first-time users than traditional ones. An online study conducted with 236 real users in movie domain reinforced this hypothesis. Hence, this study provides a clear message: we should compose product pages that mix complementary non-personalized RSs.","2019-02-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:38","1-12","","","80","","Information Systems","The Pure Cold-Start Problem","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\D2HAJKHG\S0306437918303260.html","","","e-commerce systems; First-time users; Non-personalized recommender systems; Pure Cold-Start problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Voting advice applications (VAAs) recommend parties and candidates that are close to a citizen's political preferences and require the constrution of candidate and party profiles. Profile generation is an essential task in the development of VAAs and requires two steps: an unbiased design of political questionnaires and the collection of all candidates' answers. This paper presents an extension of a VAA, implemented in within the project Participa Inteligente (PI), a social-network platform designed for the 2017 Ecuadorian national elections. This work concentrates on the implementation of dynamic candidate profiling using Twitter data and sentiment analysis as an additional element to the static profile generation of VAAs. The implementation of a dynamic element for VAAs could help mitigate the effect of biased recommendations given during the construction of candidate and party profiles. At the end of this work, the dynamic profile is compared with the classic static elements developed within the PI project. The results show the level of similarities and differences between each of the elements in profile generation. This work provides an ideal basis for future research in the area of VAAs and their interfaces. Additionally, it opens up a broader spectrum of applications for policymakers including decision-making and collaborative working environments toward e-empowerment.","2019-07-01","2021-01-21 08:29:38","2021-01-21 08:33:28","2021-01-21 08:29:38","520-535","","3","36","","Government Information Quarterly","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\38VCLMKG\S0740624X18300716.html","","","Decision-making; Dynamic profiles; Recommender systems; Sentiment analysis; Voting advice applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When conducting these experiments, it is a common practice to randomly assign customers into test/control groups and assume that the behavior of a customer is not dependent on the assignment of another customer. We see the necessity to verify this assumption given the complex dynamics inside an online marketplace. Our way is to embrace a regression model for experiment response and study if the interference between test and control make a statistically significant regressor. To minimize the interference we advocate for changing the randomization and develop a system in support of that. A category based strategy is explored in detail. It leads to a much smaller sample size so we further discuss the application of transformation and variance reduction techniques in the analysis. We report encouraging results by taking logarithm of the response metric and leveraging pre-experiment data as covariates in the regression. While the described work is for a specific scenario, we believe the design and analysis can be generalized and used at other places to achieve trustworthy online experimentation.","2018-11","2021-01-21 11:12:17","2021-01-21 11:12:17","","1447-1452","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2375-9259","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\A2GGCWHW\8637527.html","","","A/B test, controlled experiment, design of experiment, interference effect, randomization strategy, poststratification; A/B tests; Automobiles; business data processing; category based strategy; Conferences; consumer behaviour; customer behaviour; data analysis; DP industry; Estimation; Feeds; IEEE merchandise; Interference; Internet; Internet companies; Measurement; online marketplace; program testing; randomization; regression analysis; regression model; statistical analysis; variance reduction techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces a framework for creating and utilizing user behavioral segments in online experimentation. By using the data of user engagement with individual product components as input, this method defines segments that are closely related to the features being evaluated in the product development cycle.

Product ideas are evaluated as scientific hypotheses, and tested on web sites, mobile applications, desktop applications, services, and operating system features. One of the key challenges for organizations that run controlled experiments is to select an Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC), i.e., the criterion by which to evaluate the different variants. The difficulty is that short-term changes to metrics may not predict the long-term impact of a change. For example, raising prices likely increases short-term revenue but also likely reduces long-term revenue (customer lifetime value) as users abandon. Degrading search results in a Search Engine causes users to search more, thus increasing query share short-term, but increasing abandonment and thus reducing longterm customer lifetime value. Ideally, an OEC is based on metrics in a short-term experiment that are good predictors of long-term value. To assess long-term impact, one approach is to run longterm controlled experiments and assume that long-term effects are represented by observed metrics. In this paper we share several examples of long-term experiments and the pitfalls associated with running them. We discuss cookie stability, survivorship bias, selection bias, and perceived trends, and share methodologies that can be used to partially address some of these issues. While there is clearly value in evaluating long-term trends, experimenters running long-term experiments must be cautious, as results may be due to the above pitfalls more than the true delta between the Treatment and Control. We hope our real examples and analyses will sensitize readers to the issues and encourage the development of new methodologies for this important problem.","2016-12","2021-01-21 11:12:25","2021-01-21 11:12:25","","1367-1376","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\98GNPYQ9\7840744.html","","","A/B testing; Browsers; Controlled experiments; cookie stability; Degradation; Google; Internet; long-term online controlled experiments; longterm customer lifetime value; Market research; Measurement; OEC; Online experiments; overall evaluation criterion; scientific hypotheses; search engine; search engines; selection bias; software engineering; software product development; survivorship bias; Testing; Web sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key aspect of A/B testing is evaluation of experiment results. Designing the right set of metrics - correct outcome measures, data quality indicators, guardrails that prevent harm to business, and a comprehensive set of supporting metrics to understand the ""why"" behind the key movements is the #1 challenge practitioners face when trying to scale their experimentation program [18, 22]. On the technical side, improving sensitivity of experiment metrics is a hard problem and an active research area, with large practical implications as more and more small and medium size businesses are trying to adopt A/B testing and suffer from insufficient power.

Despite their great power in identifying what customers actually value, experimentation is very sensitive to data loss, skipped checks, wrong designs, and many other 'hiccups' in the analysis process. For this purpose, experiment analysis has traditionally been done by experienced data analysts and scientists that closely monitored experiments throughout their lifecycle. Depending solely on scarce experts, however, is neither scalable nor bulletproof. To democratize experimentation, analysis should be streamlined and meticulously performed by engineers, managers, or others responsible for the development of a product. In this paper, based on synthesized experience of companies that run thousands of OCEs per year, we examined how experts inspect online experiments. We reveal that most of the experiment analysis happens before OCEs are even started, and we summarize the key analysis steps in three checklists. The value of the checklists is threefold. First, they can increase the accuracy of experiment se-tup and decision-making process. Second, checklists can enable novice data scientists and software engineers to become more autonomous in setting-up and analyzing experiments. Finally, they can serve as a base to develop trustworthy platforms and tools for OCE set-up and analysis.","2019-05-27","2021-01-22 10:16:20","2021-01-22 10:16:20","2021-01-22","1–10","","","","","","","ICSE-SEIP '19","","","","IEEE Press","Montreal, Quebec, Canada","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","a/b testing; experiment checklists; online controlled experiments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most challenging problem is to define an appropriate online metric of user behavior, so-called Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC), which is both interpretable and sensitive. A typical OEC consists of a key metric and an evaluation statistic. Sensitivity of an OEC to the treatment effect of an A/B test is measured by a statistical significance test. We introduce the notion of Overall Acceptance Criterion (OAC) that includes both the components of an OEC and a statistical significance test. While existing studies on A/B tests are mostly concentrated on the first component of an OAC, its key metric, we widely study the two latter ones by comparison of several statistics and several statistical tests with respect to user engagement metrics on hundreds of A/B experiments run on real users of Yandex. We discovered that the application of the state-of-the-art Student's t-tests to several main user engagement metrics may lead to an underestimation of the false-positive rate by an order of magnitude.

Online controlled experiments, also known as A/B tests, enable software companies to establish causal relationships between changes in their systems and the movements in the metrics. By experimenting, product development can be directed towards identifying and delivering value. Previous research stresses the need for data-driven development and experimentation. However, the level of granularity in which existing models explain the experimentation process is neither sufficient, in terms of details, nor scalable, in terms of how to increase number and run different types of experiments, in an online setting. Based on a case study of multiple products running online controlled experiments at Microsoft, we provide an experimentation framework composed of two detailed experimentation models focused on two main aspects; the experimentation activities and the experimentation metrics. This work intends to provide guidelines to companies and practitioners on how to set and organize experimentation activities for running trustworthy online controlled experiments.","2018","2021-01-22 10:28:16","2021-01-22 10:28:16","","182-198","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\BCIE8E6W\Issa Mattos et al. - 2018 - An Activity and Metric Model for Online Controlled.pdf","","","A/B tests; Data-driven development; Online controlled experiments","Kuhrmann, Marco; Schneider, Kurt; Pfahl, Dietmar; Amasaki, Sousuke; Ciolkowski, Marcus; Hebig, Regina; Tell, Paolo; Klünder, Jil; Küpper, Steffen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In online companies, controlled experimentation is the primary technique to measure how customers respond to variants of deployed software. In B2B companies, an interest for data driven development is rapidly emerging and experiments are run on selected instances of the system or as comparisons of previously computed data to ensure quality, improve configurations and explore new value propositions. Although the adoption of data driven development is challenging in general, it is especially so for embedded systems companies and for companies developing on-premise software solutions. Due to complex systems with hardware dependencies, safety-critical functionality and strict regulations, these companies have longer development cycles, less frequent deployments and limited access to data. In this paper, and based on multi-case study research, we explore the specific challenges that embedded systems companies and companies developing on-premise solutions experience when adopting data driven development practices. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we provide empirical evidence in which we identify the key challenges that embedded systems and on-premise software solutions companies experience as they evolve through the process of adopting data driven development practices. Second, we define the key focus areas that these companies need to address for evolving their data driven development adoption process .","2019","2021-01-22 10:28:40","2021-01-22 10:28:40","","515-527","","","","","","Data Driven Development","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\L5YKUIES\Holmström Olsson and Bosch - 2019 - Data Driven Development Challenges in Online, Emb.pdf","","","Adoption process; Challenges; Data driven development; Embedded systems; On-premise solutions; Online software","Franch, Xavier; Männistö, Tomi; Martínez-Fernández, Silverio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real-world ML applications help companies to improve products and automate tasks such as classification, image recognition and automation. However, a traditional “fixed” approach where the system is frozen before deployment leads to a sub-optimal system performance. Systems autonomously experimenting with and improving their own behavior and performance could improve business outcomes but we need to know how this could actually work in practice. While there is some research on autonomously improving systems, the focus on the concepts and theoretical algorithms. However, less research is focused on empirical industry validation of the proposed theory. Empirical validations are usually done through simulations or by using synthetic or manually alteration of datasets. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we conduct a systematic literature review in which we focus on papers describing industrial deployments of autonomously improving systems and their real-world applications. Secondly, we identify open research questions and derive a model that classifies the level of autonomy based on our findings in the literature review.","2021","2021-01-22 10:28:56","2021-01-22 10:28:56","","30-45","","","","","","Autonomously Improving Systems in Industry","Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\WH9ELB7V\Green et al. - 2021 - Autonomously Improving Systems in Industry A Syst.pdf","","","AI engineering; Autonomously improving systems; Empirical validation; Industrial application; Machine learning","Klotins, Eriks; Wnuk, Krzysztof","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features.

We provide several examples of controlled experiments with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running controlled experiments, and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. Controlled experiments typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain deeper understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements.

Furthermore, the high cost of usability evaluation forces small/medium-sized companies to trust the first solution applied, without actually testing the success of the solution or considering a possible regression in usability, as could be highlighted by an iterative testing method. In this article, we advocate for a usability improvement cycle oriented by user feedback, and compatible with an agile development process. We propose an iterative method supported by a toolkit that allows usability experts to design user tests, run them remotely, analyze results, and assess alternative solutions to usability problems similarly to A/B testing. Each solution is created by applying client-side web refactorings, i.e., changes to the web pages in the client which are meant to improve usability. The main benefit of our approach is that it reduces the overall cost of user testing and particularly, A/B testing, by applying refactorings to create alternative solutions without modifying the application’s server code. By making it affordable for usability experts to apply the method in parallel with the development cycle, we aim to encourage them to incorporate user feedback and try different ideas to discover the best-performing solution in terms of the metrics of interest.","2019-03-01","2021-01-22 10:29:17","2021-01-22 10:29:17","2021-01-22 10:29:17","203-240","","1","27","","Software Qual J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\L6V7Z5VP\Firmenich et al. - 2019 - Usability improvement through AB testing and refa.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the number of experiments scale, companies aim to invest their experimentation resources in larger feature changes and leave the automated techniques to optimize smaller features. Optimization experiments in the continuous space are encompassed in the many-armed bandits class of problems. Although previous research provides algorithms for solving this class of problems, these algorithms were not implemented in real-world online experimentation problems and do not consider the application constraints, such as time to compute a solution, selection of a best arm and the estimation of the mean-reward function. This work discusses the online experiments in context of the many-armed bandits class of problems and provides three main contributions: (1) an algorithm modification to include online experiments constraints, (2) implementation of this algorithm in an industrial setting in collaboration with Sony Mobile, and (3) statistical evidence that supports the modification of the algorithm for online experiments scenarios. These contributions support the relevance of the LG-HOO algorithm in the context of optimization experiments and show how the algorithm can be used to support continuous optimization of online systems in stochastic scenarios.","2018","2021-01-22 10:29:22","2021-01-22 10:29:22","","293-308","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\8SU6TIXE\Mattos et al. - 2018 - Optimization Experiments in the Continuous Space.pdf","","","Continuous-space optimization; Infinitely many-armed bandits; Multi-armed bandits; Online experiments","Colanzi, Thelma Elita; McMinn, Phil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, unless university-based researchers closely collaborate with industry or develop their own infrastructure or user base, they cannot validate their ideas in live settings with real users. Without online testing opportunities open to the research communities, academic researchers are unable to employ online evaluation on a larger scale. This means that they do not get feedback for their ideas and cannot advance their research further. Businesses, on the other hand, miss the opportunity to have higher customer satisfaction due to improved systems. In addition, users miss the chance to benefit from an improved information access system. In this chapter, we introduce two evaluation initiatives at CLEF, NewsREEL and Living Labs for IR (LL4IR), that aim to address this growing “evaluation gap” between academia and industry.

Scientists come up with hypotheses (models) to explain physical phenomena, and validate these models by comparing their output to observations in nature. A scientific field consists then merely by a collection of hypotheses that could not been disproved (yet) when compared to nature. Evaluation plays the exact key role in the field of information retrieval. Researchers and practitioners develop models to explain the relation between an information need expressed by a person and information contained in available resources, and test these models by comparing their outcomes to collections of observations.This article is a short survey on methods, measures, and designs used in the field of Information Retrieval to evaluate the quality of search algorithms (aka the implementation of a model) against collections of observations. The phrase “search quality” has more than one interpretations, however here I will only discuss one of these interpretations, the effectiveness of a search algorithm to find the information requested by a user. There are two types of collections of observations used for the purpose of evaluation: (a) relevance annotations, and (b) observable user behaviour. I will call the evaluation framework based on the former a collection-based evaluation, while the one based on the latter an in-situ evaluation.This survey is far from complete; it only presents my personal viewpoint on the recent developments in the field.","2016","2021-01-22 10:29:37","2021-01-22 10:29:37","2021-01-22 10:29:37","38-87","","","","","","","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-41718-9_3","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\PBFATJAW\Kanoulas - 2016 - A Short Survey on Online and Offline Methods for S.pdf","","","Implicit Feedback; Mouse Movement; Relevance Judgment; Search Engine; Test Collection","Braslavski, Pavel; Markov, Ilya; Pardalos, Panos; Volkovich, Yana; Ignatov, Dmitry I.; Koltsov, Sergei; Koltsova, Olessia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, a social media website may need to quickly identify status updates linking to malicious websites to block them. The URL is very concise, and may be composed of concatenated words so classification with only this information is a very challenging task. Methods proposed for this task, for example, the all-grams approach which extracts all possible sub-strings as features, provide reasonable accuracy but do not scale well to large datasets.We have recently proposed a new method for URL-based web page classification. We have introduced an n-gram language model for this task as a method that provides competitive accuracy and scalability to larger datasets. Our method allows for the classification of new URLs with unseen sub-sequences. In this paper we extend our presentation and include additional results to validate the proposed approach. We explain the parameters associated with the n-gram language model and test their impact on the models produced. Our results show that our method is competitive in terms of accuracy with the best known methods but also scales well for larger datasets.","2015","2021-01-22 10:29:39","2021-01-22 10:29:39","","19-33","","","","","","URL-Based Web Page Classification","Communications in Computer and Information Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\78RKZNEB\Abdallah and de La Iglesia - 2015 - URL-Based Web Page Classification With n-Gram Lan.pdf","","","Information retrieval; Language models; Machine learning; Web classification; Web mining","Fred, Ana; Dietz, Jan L.

To implement the model and collect test data, FireShare was developed as a plugin for the popular Web browser Firefox.

PlanOut separates experimental design from application code, allowing the experimenter to concisely describe experimental designs, whether common ""A/B tests"" and factorial designs, or more complex designs involving conditional logic or multiple experimental units. These latter designs are often useful for understanding causal mechanisms involved in user behaviors. We demonstrate how experiments from the literature can be implemented in PlanOut, and describe two large field experiments conducted on Facebook with PlanOut.

Controlled experiments embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and their influence on user-observable behavior. We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Person's Opinion (HiPPO). We provide several examples of controlled experiments with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running controlled experiments, and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. Controlled experiments typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain deeper understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements. Organizations that embrace controlled experiments with clear evaluation criteria can evolve their systems with automated optimizations and real-time analyses.
