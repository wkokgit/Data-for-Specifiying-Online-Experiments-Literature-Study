During an experiment, each user is randomly redirected to one of two versions of the website, called treatments. Several response models were proposed to describe the behavior of a user in a social network website as a function of the treatment assigned to her and to her neighbors. However, there is no consensus as to which model should be applied to a given dataset. In this work, we propose a new response model, derive theoretical limits for the estimation error of several models, and obtain empirical results for cases where the response model was misspecified.","2018-12","2021-01-21 11:12:11","2021-01-21 11:12:11","","540-545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\S44MR5GM\8609643.html","","","analytical error bounds; business decisions; Computational modeling; Crámer-Rao theorem; data analysis; estimation error; Estimation error; estimation theory; Internet; Logistics; Maximum likelihood estimation; model misspecification; network A/B testing; response model; response models; sample variance; Social network services; social network website; social networking (online); Sociology; statistical analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurement on overall experiment sample is a common practice to quantify the overall treatment effect. In order to understand why the treatment effect occurs in a certain way, segmentation becomes a valuable approach to a finer analysis of experiment results. This paper introduces a framework for creating and utilizing user behavioral segments in online experimentation. By using the data of user engagement with individual product components as input, this method defines segments that are closely related to the features being evaluated in the product development cycle. With a real-world example we demonstrate that the analysis with such behavioral segments offered deep, actionable insights that successfully informed product decision making.","2017-10","2021-01-21 11:12:21","2021-01-21 11:12:21","","69-78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\wouterkok\Zotero\storage\G9U777UX\8259765.html","","","A/B testing; behavioral segmentation; Clustering algorithms; Computational modeling; consumer behaviour; Controlled experiment; data mining; Data models; decision making; Feature extraction; Finance; individual product components; inform product change; informed product decision making; Internet; mobile applications; mobile computing; online controlled experimentation; online experimentation; product development; Product development; product development cycle; rapid development cycle; Segmentation; unsupervised learning; Unsupervised learning; User behavior; user behavioral segment utilization; user engagement; web products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
